# KatieHoult-DjangoAssignment

## Data
To demonstrate that an account manager can only make an account for an existing registered club, I have created a dummy data set with names of clubs that will be displayed on the form where the account manager creates or edits the account details.

## Admin Page Login
localhost:8000/admin will open the built-in admin page where the super user login details are as follows:
USERNAME: KatieHoult
PASSWORD: Adminkkh01

## Account ManagerLogin Page
An account manager user has been set up to allow the login page to be demonstrated:
USERNAME: Hkylie2022
PASSWORD: Avatar!01

## Docker images and container
To get the docker images and run the container, use command: docker-compose up -d
